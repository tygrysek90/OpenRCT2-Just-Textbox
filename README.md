### Thanks to & building from source
Wait, how this can be together?

Easily! Since I wanted to thank to [Basssiiie](https://github.com/Basssiiie) for creating OpenRCT2-Simple-Typescript-Template and FlexUi that i boldly use in this micro-plugin, lol ... and there is my own plugin template that actually combines both of those two, and you can read [build instruction there](https://github.com/tygrysek90/OpenRCT2-Tiger-Plugin-Template?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-start). Or if you are familiar with Basssiiie's template, just look at extra commands in `package.json`.
